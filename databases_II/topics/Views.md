# Understanding SQL Views

## Introduction:

In SQL, views are a powerful tool that simplifies the complexity of queries and provides an abstract layer over underlying tables. Views are crucial in database design as they offer an efficient way to manage and access stored data.

## Concept of Views:

Views in SQL are pre-defined queries stored in the database as if they were virtual tables. These queries can contain selections, projections, aggregations, and constraints, creating a logical representation of the data. By creating a view, it can be accessed as if it were a real table, simplifying complex queries and providing an abstraction layer.

## Usage Scenarios:

- Query Simplification: Views allow encapsulation of complex query logic and simplify data access.

- Access Security: By limiting visible columns in a view, access to sensitive data in underlying tables can be controlled.

- Data Abstraction: Views offer an abstraction layer, enabling changes to the underlying structure without affecting queries using the view.

## Types of Views:

- Simple Views: Based on a single table or query.

```
CREATE VIEW MonthlySalesView AS
SELECT 
    product_id,
    MONTH(sale_date) AS month,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_sales
FROM 
    sales
GROUP BY 
    product_id, MONTH(sale_date);
```
*Compatible with most relational database engines such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, SQLite.*

- Indexed Views: Allow the creation of indexes on the view, improving query performance.

```
CREATE VIEW IndexedSalaryView WITH SCHEMABINDING AS
SELECT 
    d.department_id,
    d.department_name,
    AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM 
    dbo.departments d
JOIN 
    dbo.employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY 
    d.department_id, d.department_name;

-- Create view index
CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_SalaryView_Department
ON IndexedSalaryView (department_id);
```
*PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle are examples of systems that support indexed views. Terminology and syntax may vary.*

- Updatable Views: Permit insertion, updating, and deletion operations, although not always applicable.

```
CREATE VIEW UpdatableOrders AS
SELECT 
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    order_status
FROM 
    orders
WHERE 
    order_status = 'Pending';
```
*SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle. The ability to update depends on the update rules defined in the view and the complexity of the view.*

- Materialized Views: Materialized views are an advanced extension of the view concept. Instead of running in real-time, they physically store the results of the query in a temporary table. This significantly improves performance in scenarios where data changes less frequently and queries are intensive.

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW MonthlySalesSummary
AS
SELECT 
    product_id,
    MONTH(sale_date) AS month,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM 
    sales
GROUP BY 
    product_id, MONTH(sale_date);
```
*Synapse, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL (via extensions like "Materialized Views for MySQL"). Syntax and specific features may vary depending on the database management system.*

## Conclusion:

Views in SQL are a fundamental tool to simplify data access and provide an abstraction layer. By understanding usage scenarios and types of views available, developers can optimize database design and enhance query efficiency. Materialized views take this concept further by providing improved performance in specific use cases.
